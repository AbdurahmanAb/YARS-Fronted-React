-   **API Functions:**

    -   Store them in `utilities/api`.
    -   Refer to `example.js` for structure.
    -   Use `baseUrl` from `api.config.js`.
    -   To send request with admin tokens, wrap your headers with `withAdminTokenHeader` function.

    ```js
    axios.get(<URL>, withAdminTokenHeader())
    or
    axios.get(<URL>, withAdminTokenHeader({additional headers here}))
    ```
